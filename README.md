Simple Auto Sub-Downloader v1

What is it capable of?
This script will check your desired folder every X minutes, If there is an missing subtitle. If there is It will download it and rename it as same as video file (without language tag). And It does this quietly you don't even realize.

Also you can manually download subtitles from context menu. (Only folders and .avi .mkv .mp4 files) 

Tested on Windows 7 and Windows 8.

How to Install?
Before installing this script I suggest you to uninstall Filebot and let the batch file to install a clean and updated FileBot.

Supported Languages
Turkish and English. 
Except the batch file you will have only 2 strings that is foreign language. (In Context Menu)

What is the purpose?
I don't think this script attract more attention. Like I said I made it for myself. And I think it's a very nice script for Newbies and Simple Lovers. It is doing fine for me to use Serviio,Smart TV and ServiiGo,Smart Phone and PotPlayer.
